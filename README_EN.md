A real-time battle data statistics tool for the game "Star Resonance" that uses network packet capture technology to analyze battle data in real-time, providing damage statistics, DPS calculations, and other features.

The accuracy of this tool has been verified through multiple actual battles, and no data loss issues have been found under stable network conditions.

This tool does not require modifying the game client and does not violate game service terms. The tool aims to help players better understand battle data, reduce ineffective improvements, and enhance the gaming experience. Before using this tool, please ensure that the data results will not be used for power discrimination or other behaviors that damage the game community environment.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### One-Click Usage

Visit the [GitHub Actions page](https://github.com/dmlgzs/StarResonanceDamageCounter/actions) to download the latest auto-packaged version.

Visit the [Release page](https://github.com/dmlgzs/StarResonanceDamageCounter/releases) to download the release version.

Visit [Quark Cloud Drive](https://pan.quark.cn/s/89c4795e0751) to download the release version.

### Manual Compilation

#### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** >= 22.15.0
- **pnpm** >= 10.13.1
- **WinPcap/Npcap** (Network packet capture driver)
- **Visual Studio Build Tools** (Compilation dependency)
  - Can be installed via [Visual Studio Installer](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)
  - Select "C++ build tools" workload
- **Python** 3.10 (Compilation dependency)
  - Can be downloaded and installed from [Python official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  - Ensure Python is added to system PATH

#### Installation Steps

1. **Clone Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dmlgzs/StarResonanceDamageCounter.git
   cd StarResonanceDamageCounter
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   corepack enable
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Install WinPcap/Npcap**
   - Download and install [Npcap](https://nmap.org/npcap/) or [WinPcap](https://www.winpcap.org/) (Npcap recommended)
   - Ensure "WinPcap API-compatible mode" is selected during installation

4. **Run**

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

   After running, you will be prompted to:
   - Select the network device for packet capture (you can check network adapter information through Control Panel)
   - Select log level (`info`: basic information, `debug`: detailed logs)

   You can also specify directly through command line parameters:

   ```bash
   node server.js <device_number> <log_level>
   ```

   Or use auto-detection mode (recommended):

   ```bash
   node server.js auto info
   ```

   Auto-detection mode will:
   - Intelligently identify physical network cards, excluding virtual network cards (such as ZeroTier, VMware, etc.)
   - Analyze 3 seconds of network traffic and automatically select the most active network card
   - Fall back to routing table method when there's no traffic

   Manual specification example:

   ```bash
   node server.js 4 info
   ```

### Usage Instructions

1. **Select Network Device**
   - After starting the program, a list of available network devices will be displayed
   - Enter the corresponding device number shown in the program output list (usually select the main network card)
   - You can go to Control Panel or System Settings to find the network card you're using

2. **Set Log Level**
   - Choose log level: `info` or `debug`
   - Recommend using `info` level to reduce log output

3. **Start Game**
   - The program will automatically detect game server connections
   - When a game server is detected, it will output server information and start collecting statistics

4. **View Data**
   - Open browser and visit: `http://localhost:8989`
   - View real-time battle data statistics

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Cannot detect game server**
   - Check if network device selection is correct
   - Confirm the game is running and connected to server
   - Try going to a non-crowded area on the same map

2. **Web interface cannot be accessed**
   - Check if port 8989 is occupied
   - Confirm firewall settings allow local connections

3. **Abnormal data statistics**
   - Check log output for error messages
   - Try restarting the program to recapture

4. **cap module compilation error**
   - Ensure Visual Studio Build Tools and Python are installed
   - Confirm Node.js version meets requirements

5. **Program exits immediately after startup**
   - Ensure Npcap is installed
   - Confirm correct network device number is entered
